# Accessibility Implementation Checklist

This checklist outlines the accessibility improvements needed in our frontend components based on test results. Use this as a guide to ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## General Improvements

- [ ] Install the `canvas` npm package to support accessibility testing with jest-axe
- [ ] Set up automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Update linting rules to catch common accessibility issues

## Navigation Components

- [ ] Add proper landmark roles to navigation components
  - [ ] Add `role="navigation"` to the main nav element
  - [ ] Ensure all navigation regions have `aria-label` attributes
- [ ] Implement skip links for keyboard users
  - [ ] Add "Skip to main content" link at the beginning of the page
  - [ ] Ensure skip link is visible on focus
- [ ] Improve dropdown menu accessibility
  - [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes (aria-haspopup, aria-expanded)
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation within dropdown menus
- [ ] Fix tab order to ensure logical keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Check tabindex attributes
  - [ ] Ensure focus indicators are visible

## Form Components

- [ ] Ensure all form inputs have associated labels
  - [ ] Use explicit label elements with for/id association
  - [ ] Add aria-labelledby for complex labeling situations
- [ ] Add proper error handling and announcements
  - [ ] Connect error messages to inputs using aria-describedby
  - [ ] Use aria-invalid for inputs with errors
- [ ] Implement fieldsets and legends for grouped inputs
- [ ] Add clear focus states for all interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure required fields are properly marked

## Modal Components

- [ ] Create an accessible Modal component with:
  - [ ] Role="dialog" and aria-modal="true"
  - [ ] Proper heading structure with aria-labelledby
  - [ ] Focus trap when modal is open
  - [ ] Return focus to trigger element when closed
  - [ ] Close on ESC key press
  - [ ] Proper z-index management

## Toast/Notification Components

- [ ] Create an accessible Toast component with:
  - [ ] Appropriate ARIA live regions (polite for info, assertive for errors)
  - [ ] Proper roles (status, alert)
  - [ ] Timed auto-dismissal with sufficient time to read
  - [ ] Manual dismiss option with keyboard accessibility
  - [ ] Proper color contrast for different toast types

## Error Handling

- [ ] Implement accessible error boundaries with:
  - [ ] Clear error messages
  - [ ] Proper focus management when errors occur
  - [ ] Instructions on how to recover
  - [ ] aria-live regions for dynamic error announcements

## Implementation Priorities

1. Navigation improvements
   - Skip links and landmark roles are highest priority
   
2. Form components
   - Labels and error messages are critical for usability
   
3. Modals and dialogs
   - Ensure keyboard trapping and focus management
   
4. Toast notifications
   - Ensure screen readers can announce status changes

## Testing Approach

1. Fix automated tests first to provide guidance
2. Implement component changes
3. Verify with both automated and manual testing:
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Screen reader testing
   - Color contrast verification
   - Touch target sizing for mobile
