# Vitest Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue

There appears to be a versioning conflict with the Vitest configuration and dependencies in the GplusApp project. The error messages indicate:

1. Missing JSDOM dependency
2. Version conflicts with @vitest/coverage-v8
3. Conflicts between Vite versions (peer dependencies)

## Root Causes

1. The project references outdated or incompatible versions of Vitest dependencies
2. The `vitest.config.js` file is using features that require specific versions
3. There might be conflicts between globally and locally installed packages

## Solutions

### Option 1: Update package.json

Create a proper package.json with compatible versions:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^4.4.5",
    "vitest": "^0.34.6",
    "jsdom": "^22.1.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.1.0"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Simplified Test Configuration

Create a minimal `vitest.config.js`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'node'
  }
});
```

### Option 3: Run Tests Without Coverage

If the coverage reporter is causing issues:

```bash
vitest run --no-coverage
```

## Steps to Fix

1. Backup your current package.json and vitest.config.js
2. Update to a simpler configuration that avoids version conflicts
3. Install compatible dependencies
4. Run tests with minimal configuration first, then add features one by one

## For VSCode Extension Issues

If the VSCode extension is showing errors:

1. Try disabling and re-enabling the extension
2. Check that your workspace settings don't override global Vitest configurations
3. Ensure the extension is looking at the correct test configuration file

## Long-Term Solution

Consider moving to a standardized testing setup like:

1. Create-React-App's built-in test runner
2. Jest with React Testing Library
3. A fresh Vite + Vitest setup using the latest template
