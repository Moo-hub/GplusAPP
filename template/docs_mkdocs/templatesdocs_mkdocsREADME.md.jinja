# {{ project.name }} - Documentation (MkDocs)

This directory contains the documentation for your {{ project.name }} project, built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## Setup

1.  **Navigate to the documentation directory:**
    ```bash
    cd docs
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python and pip installed.
    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
    ```
    {% if component_features.DocsMkDocs.mermaid_diagrams %}
    If you enabled Mermaid.js, you might also need:
    ```bash
    pip install pymdown-extensions
    ```
    (This is usually included with mkdocs-material for `pymdownx.superfences`, but good to note)
    {% endif %}

## Development

To serve the documentation locally and preview changes in real-time:

```bash
mkdocs serve
