Summary: Contract verified with programmatic OpenAPI check and backend TestClient integration tests running green locally. Continuing incremental UI/i18n work on `feature/refactor-batch-2` while CI runs on this Draft.

Notes:
- OpenAPI path `/api/v1/environmental/impacts` exists and is tagged once ("Environmental").
- Backend TestClient integration tests passed locally (2 passed). There are non-blocking deprecation warnings related to Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0 imports, and FastAPI `on_event` deprecation; these are documented below and scheduled as small follow-ups to avoid blocking this Draft.

Follow-ups (scheduled as low-risk tasks):
1. Pydantic v2 migration: update model configs to `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` where needed and migrate `orm_mode` usages incrementally.
2. SQLAlchemy 2.0 imports: replace legacy imports with `sqlalchemy.orm.declarative_base()` and `sqlalchemy.orm.as_declarative` where applicable.
3. FastAPI lifespan: move startup/shutdown logic from `@app.on_event` to a `lifespan` function per FastAPI guidance.

Next steps for reviewers:
- Keep the `View` presentational-only; data fetching/state reside in the Container/Hook.
- CI will run on this Draft â€” I will push small follow-ups (UI polish, i18n keys, frontend negative tests) and run TestClient locally after each push to validate the contract.
- Once CI is green and the above items are addressed or scheduled, convert the Draft to Ready for review.

(If you'd like, I can open the three follow-up tasks as issues or create PRs; I have prepared low-risk migration notes in the repository under `.github/technical-tasks/`.)
