# Security Audit Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the security audit process for the GPlus Recycling App. Regular security audits help identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities in the application, ensuring the protection of user data and system integrity.

## Audit Components

A comprehensive security audit for the GPlus Recycling App includes:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies
2. **Code Analysis**: Find security issues in application code
3. **Configuration Review**: Check for misconfigurations and security best practices
4. **Manual Testing**: Validate security controls through manual testing

## Prerequisites

Before starting a security audit, ensure the following tools are installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- Python packages:
  - safety
  - bandit
- Node.js packages:
  - eslint
  - eslint-plugin-security

You can install the required Python tools with:

```bash
pip install safety bandit
```

## Running the Security Audit

The GPlus Recycling App includes a security audit script that automates most of the audit process. The script can be run with different scopes depending on the areas you want to focus on.

### Full Audit

To run a complete security audit covering all areas:

```bash
python backend/scripts/security_audit.py --scope all
```

### Focused Audits

To run specific parts of the audit:

```bash
# Dependencies only
python backend/scripts/security_audit.py --scope dependencies

# Code analysis only
python backend/scripts/security_audit.py --scope code

# Configuration review only
python backend/scripts/security_audit.py --scope config
```

### Custom Report Location

By default, reports are saved to the `security_reports` directory in the project root. You can specify a custom location:

```bash
python backend/scripts/security_audit.py --report-dir /path/to/reports
```

## Understanding Audit Results

The security audit generates two reports:

1. **JSON Report**: Contains detailed findings in machine-readable format
2. **Markdown Report**: Human-readable summary with recommendations

The reports include:

- Summary of vulnerabilities by severity
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Code vulnerabilities
- Configuration issues
- Recommendations for remediation

## Manual Security Testing

In addition to the automated audit, perform the following manual tests:

### Authentication Testing

- Test brute force protection by attempting multiple failed logins
- Verify password complexity requirements
- Test password reset functionality
- Check for session timeout and invalidation

### Authorization Testing

- Verify access controls by attempting to access resources without proper authorization
- Test API endpoints with different user roles
- Attempt to bypass access controls through direct API calls

### Input Validation

- Test form inputs with malicious data (SQL injection, XSS)
- Verify file uploads are properly validated and sanitized
- Test API endpoints with unexpected input values

### Security Headers and Protection

- Verify proper HTTP security headers using tools like [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/)
- Check for CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- Verify Content Security Policy implementation

## Remediation Process

After completing the security audit:

1. **Prioritize Issues**: Address critical and high-severity issues first
2. **Create Tickets**: Document each security issue in your issue tracking system
3. **Implement Fixes**: Make necessary code and configuration changes
4. **Verify Fixes**: Re-test to ensure vulnerabilities have been properly remediated
5. **Update Documentation**: Document security improvements and update security guidelines

## Regular Audit Schedule

Establish a regular security audit schedule:

- Full security audit: Quarterly
- Dependency scanning: Monthly
- Code reviews: On every major release
- Configuration review: Monthly

## Security Audit Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure comprehensive coverage:

- [ ] Run automated dependency scanning
- [ ] Perform static code analysis
- [ ] Review application configuration
- [ ] Test authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Verify authorization controls
- [ ] Check input validation
- [ ] Validate output encoding
- [ ] Review error handling
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Check security headers
- [ ] Review Docker security
- [ ] Test secure communication (TLS/SSL)
- [ ] Verify data encryption
- [ ] Review logging and monitoring
- [ ] Test security event alerting

## Recommended Tools

In addition to the built-in security audit script, consider using these tools:

- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security scanner
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security scanner
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Docker Bench Security**: Docker security best practices checker
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanner
