## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows these key principles:

1. **Test Pyramid**: We prioritize unit tests (fast, numerous) over integration tests (fewer, slower) and end-to-end tests (fewest, slowest but most comprehensive).
2. **Component-Centric Testing**: Each component is tested in isolation with appropriate mocks.
3. **User-Centric Testing**: Tests focus on verifying user workflows and interactions rather than implementation details.
4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: For critical features and bug fixes, we write tests first, then implement the code.
5. **Continuous Testing**: Tests run automatically as part of our CI/CD pipeline.

## Coverage Goals

We aim to achieve and maintain the following code coverage targets:

| Component Type | Target Coverage |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Core Services | 90%+ |
| UI Components | 80%+ |
| Utility Functions | 90%+ |
| API Endpoints | 85%+ |
| Database Models | 85%+ |
| Overall Project | 80%+ |

## Testing Technologies

### Frontend Testing
- **Vitest**: Main test runner for JavaScript/React code
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing with user-centric approach
- **Jest DOM**: Additional DOM-related assertions
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: API mocking for frontend tests
- **Testing Library User Event**: Simulating user interactions

### Backend Testing
- **Pytest**: Python testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking for Python tests
- **pytest-asyncio**: Testing async code
- **FastAPI TestClient**: API endpoint testing

## Frontend Testing

### Component Tests

We test UI components at multiple levels:

1. **Pure Presentational Components**: Test rendering, props handling, styling variations
2. **Form Components**: Test validation, input handling, submission behavior
3. **Container Components**: Test data fetching, state management, child component interactions

Example component test pattern:

```jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import PickupRequestForm from '../PickupRequestForm';

describe('PickupRequestForm Component', () => {
  it('validates required fields', async () => {
    render(<PickupRequestForm />);
    
    // Attempt to submit without filling required fields
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }));
    
    // Assert validation messages appear
    expect(screen.getByText(/please select at least one material/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Hooks Tests

Custom hooks are tested using React Testing Library's `renderHook`:

```jsx
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import useOfflineStorage from '../useOfflineStorage';

describe('useOfflineStorage Hook', () => {
  it('stores and retrieves data correctly', async () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useOfflineStorage());
    
    await act(async () => {
      await result.current.storeData('test-key', { value: 'test-data' });
    });
    
    const data = await result.current.getData('test-key');
    expect(data).toEqual({ value: 'test-data' });
  });
});
```

### Service Tests

API services and utilities are tested with appropriate mocking:

```jsx
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import apiService from '../apiService';
import axios from 'axios';

vi.mock('axios');

describe('API Service', () => {
  it('handles API errors correctly', async () => {
    axios.get.mockRejectedValueOnce({ response: { status: 500 } });
    
    try {
      await apiService.getPickupRequests();
    } catch (error) {
      expect(error.isHandled).toBe(true);
      expect(error.userMessage).toBe('Unable to load pickup requests. Please try again later.');
    }
  });
});
```

### Special Feature Tests

The application has dedicated test suites for special features:

1. **Offline Mode**: Tests for service worker, IndexedDB storage, and offline UI feedback
2. **Internationalization**: Tests for translation loading and language switching
3. **Authentication Flow**: Tests for login, registration, and protected routes
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tests for viewport adjustments and touch interactions

## Backend Testing

### API Endpoint Tests

Each API endpoint is tested for:
- Authentication and authorization behavior
- Valid input handling
- Error cases and validation
- Response format and status codes

Example:

```python
def test_create_pickup_request(client, auth_headers):
    # Test data
    request_data = {
        "materials": ["PLASTIC", "GLASS"],
        "weight": 10.5,
        "pickup_date": "2023-10-15",
        "address": "123 Test St, Test City",
        "time_slot": "MORNING"
    }
    
    # Make request
    response = client.post("/api/pickups/", json=request_data, headers=auth_headers)
    
    # Assertions
    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = response.json()
    assert "id" in data
    assert data["materials"] == request_data["materials"]
```

### Database Model Tests

Model tests verify:
- Schema validation
- Relationships between models
- CRUD operations
- Business logic methods on models

### Background Job Tests

We test asynchronous background jobs by:
- Mocking the job queue
- Verifying job scheduling
- Testing job execution logic
- Checking error handling

## Test Organization

Tests are organized alongside the code they test:

```
src/
  components/
    ComponentName.jsx
    __tests__/
      ComponentName.test.jsx
  hooks/
    useHook.js
    __tests__/
      useHook.test.js
```

For backend code:

```
app/
  api/
    endpoints/
      pickup.py
      test_pickup.py
  models/
    pickup.py
    test_pickup.py
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Pull requests to the main branch
- Direct commits to the main branch
- Nightly builds for performance tests

We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, with jobs for:
- Linting and code style checking
- Running unit and integration tests
- Building and deploying preview environments
- Generating and publishing coverage reports

## Special Focus Areas

### Offline Functionality Testing

We have enhanced test coverage for offline functionality, focusing on:

1. **Service Worker**: Testing registration, activation, and update processes
2. **Caching Strategies**: Testing cache-first, network-first, and stale-while-revalidate patterns
3. **IndexedDB Storage**: Testing data persistence across browser sessions
4. **Synchronization**: Testing data sync when connectivity is restored
5. **User Interface**: Testing offline indicators and functionality limitations

### Internationalization (i18n) Testing

Tests for internationalization features include:

1. **Language Detection**: Testing automatic language detection
2. **Translation Loading**: Testing loading of language resources
3. **RTL Support**: Testing right-to-left language rendering
4. **Text Expansion**: Testing UI resilience with longer translated text
5. **Date and Number Formatting**: Testing locale-specific formatting

### Mobile Responsiveness Testing

We test mobile responsiveness using:

1. **Viewport Simulation**: Testing at different screen sizes
2. **Touch Event Testing**: Simulating touch interactions
3. **Visual Regression Testing**: Comparing component rendering across breakpoints
4. **Performance Testing**: Measuring load time and interaction performance on mobile devices

## Test Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated after each test run and published to:
- Internal documentation site
- Pull request comments (diff coverage)
- Weekly team reports (trend analysis)

Example coverage report excerpt:

```

--------------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
```

## Future Improvements

1. **E2E Testing**: Implement Cypress for end-to-end testing of critical user flows
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Add screenshot comparison for UI components
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Integrate automated a11y testing tools
4. **Load Testing**: Implement load testing for API endpoints
5. **Mutation Testing**: Add mutation testing to evaluate test quality
