# End-to-End Testing Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Cypress Configuration
- Updated `cypress.config.js` with comprehensive settings
- Added code coverage integration
- Implemented custom tasks for logging and metrics
- Configured component testing support

### 2. Added Custom Commands
- Enhanced `e2e.js` with imports and configuration
- Created accessibility testing helpers
- Added offline functionality testing helpers
- Implemented performance measurement utilities

### 3. Created Comprehensive E2E Test Suites
- **API Tests:** Direct testing of backend endpoints
- **Performance Tests:** Measuring and asserting on key performance metrics
- **Component Tests:** Isolated testing of React components
- **Data-Driven Tests:** Using fixtures for rewards redemption testing

### 4. Set Up Test Infrastructure

- Added quick-start testing guide in `TESTING.md`
- Updated project roadmap in `NEXT_STEPS.md` to mark tasks as complete

## Test Coverage

The new test suite provides coverage for:
- Complete user journeys from registration to redemption
- API endpoint functionality and error handling
- Component rendering and interaction
- Performance benchmarks and assertions
- Accessibility compliance

## Next Steps

With the end-to-end testing framework now in place, the next priorities from the roadmap are:

1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize asset loading
