# Enhanced Security Monitoring Guide

## Overview

This enhanced guide provides comprehensive security monitoring practices for the GPlus Recycling App, building on the existing monitoring framework. It integrates the Redis performance optimizations and security monitoring capabilities implemented in the application.

## Security Monitoring Architecture

### Architecture Components

1. **Application Layer Monitoring**
   - FastAPI middleware for request/response tracking
   - Security event generation and logging
   - Authentication and authorization monitoring

2. **Data Storage Monitoring**
   - Database access auditing
   - Redis security event storage with optimized performance
   - File system integrity monitoring

3. **Infrastructure Monitoring**
   - Docker container security monitoring
   - Network traffic analysis
   - System resource utilization

4. **Centralized Logging**
   - Structured log format (JSON)
   - Log aggregation via ELK Stack
   - Correlation of events across services

### Redis Security Event Store

The application uses Redis for efficient storage and processing of security events with the following optimizations:

- **Data Structure**: Hash maps for efficient storage
- **Key Expiration**: Automatic TTL for event data
- **Data Compression**: For large security event payloads
- **Memory Optimization**: Periodic cleanup of expired events
- **Pattern-based Keys**: For efficient querying and aggregation

## Security Event Categories

| Category | Description | Examples | Redis Key Pattern |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Authentication | User login events | Login success/failure, password reset | `security:auth:{timestamp}` |
| Authorization | Access control events | Permission checks, access violations | `security:access:{timestamp}` |
| Data Access | Data retrieval/modification | Records viewed, data exported | `security:data:{timestamp}` |
| Configuration | System config changes | Settings updated, user permissions changed | `security:config:{timestamp}` |
| API Usage | API endpoint activity | Request rates, payload sizes, errors | `security:api:{endpoint}:{timestamp}` |

## Monitoring Dashboard Setup

### Metrics Collection

The GPlus Recycling App exports security metrics to Prometheus using the following approach:

1. **Counter Metrics**:
   - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
   - Rate limit triggers
   - Security policy violations

2. **Gauge Metrics**:
   - Active user sessions
   - Redis memory usage
   - Security event backlog size

3. **Histogram Metrics**:
   - Authentication timing
   - API response times
   - Security event processing duration

### Dashboard Configuration

Configure Grafana with the following dashboards:

1. **Security Overview Dashboard**
   - Authentication success/failure trends
   - API usage patterns
   - Security incidents timeline

2. **Redis Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Memory usage
   - Command execution rates
   - Key expiration trends
   - Performance metrics

3. **Security Incident Dashboard**
   - Active incidents
   - Investigation status
   - Remediation tracking

## Redis Performance Optimization

### Key Redis Security Metrics

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Redis CLI Command |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Memory Usage | >70% | >85% | `INFO memory` |
| Security Event Processing Rate | >1000/min | >5000/min | Custom monitoring |
| Event Backlog Size | >10,000 | >50,000 | `SCAN` with pattern counting |
| Command Latency | >5ms avg | >20ms avg | `redis-cli --latency` |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Scheduled Maintenance**
   - Automatic cleanup of expired events
   - Data aggregation for older events
   - Memory optimization during off-peak hours

2. **Key Management**
   - Pattern-based key design for efficient lookups
   - Appropriate TTL values based on event importance
   - Avoid long key names to reduce memory overhead

3. **Data Structure Selection**
   - Hashes for efficient storage of event properties
   - Sorted sets for time-series event analysis
   - Lists for event processing queues

## Security Event Alerting

### Alert Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: Immediate action required, potential breach in progress
   - Multiple failed admin login attempts
   - Unusual data access volume
   - Security configuration changes

2. **High**: Urgent attention needed within hours
   - Repeated API abuse
   - Authentication anomalies
   - Unusual access patterns

3. **Medium**: Investigation required within a day
   - Minor policy violations
   - Performance degradation
   - Unusual user behavior

4. **Low**: Routine review within the week
   - Configuration changes
   - New user registrations
   - Periodic security reports

### Alert Delivery Channels

- **Real-time**: Slack/Teams integration, SMS, PagerDuty
- **Daily digest**: Email summary of medium/low alerts
- **Dashboard**: All alerts visualized in Grafana
- **Ticket system**: Automatic ticket creation for medium+ alerts

## Security Event Retention Policies

| Event Type | Storage Location | Retention Period | Aggregation Strategy |
|------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Critical security incidents | Database + Redis | 1 year | None - full detail |
| Authentication events | Redis → Database | 90 days | Daily summaries after 7 days |
| API usage data | Redis → Database | 30 days | Hourly summaries after 24 hours |
| System metrics | Redis → Prometheus | 14 days in Redis, 90 days in Prometheus | 5-minute averages after 24 hours |

## Using the Redis Monitoring CLI

The enhanced Redis monitoring CLI provides tools for managing security events and optimizing Redis performance:

### View Security Event Statistics

```bash
python backend/scripts/redis_monitor_cli.py --action stats
```

Example output:

```text
Security Event Statistics:
- Total events: 12,547
- Events by type:
  - Authentication: 8,320
  - Authorization: 2,105
  - Data access: 1,982
  - Configuration: 140
- Memory usage: 42.3 MB
```

### Apply Retention Policies

```bash
python backend/scripts/redis_monitor_cli.py --action retention --days 7
```

Example output:

```text
Applying retention policies:
- Processed 15,420 events
- Removed 3,254 expired events
- Aggregated 8,127 events
- Memory reclaimed: 12.4 MB
```

### Optimize Redis Memory Usage

```bash
python backend/scripts/redis_monitor_cli.py --action optimize
```

Example output:

```text
Optimizing Redis memory usage:
- Before: 78.2 MB used, 42% fragmentation
- Compressing large event payloads: 230 events processed
- Reorganizing key space: 4 patterns optimized
- After: 65.7 MB used, 12% fragmentation
- Memory savings: 12.5 MB (16%)
```

### Generate Security Report

```bash
python backend/scripts/redis_monitor_cli.py --action report --from 2023-01-01 --to 2023-01-07
```

This will generate a detailed security report in Markdown format.

## Integration with Security Audit Process

The security monitoring system integrates with the security audit process:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Daily checks against security baselines
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of security events for audit reviews
3. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated report generation for compliance requirements
4. **Incident Response**: Integration with security incident response procedures

### Security Audit Data Collection

During security audits, the Redis monitoring system can export historical data:

```bash
python backend/scripts/redis_monitor_cli.py --action export --type authentication --from 2023-01-01 --to 2023-01-31 --format csv
```

## Scheduled Maintenance Tasks

| Task | Frequency | Description | Command |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Event cleanup | Daily | Remove expired events | `--action cleanup` |
| Statistics aggregation | Daily | Create summary statistics | `--action aggregate` |
| Memory optimization | Weekly | Optimize Redis memory usage | `--action optimize` |
| Performance check | Weekly | Test Redis performance | `--action benchmark` |
| Full backup | Monthly | Export all security events | `--action export --all` |

## Monitoring and Alerting Best Practices

1. **Reduce false positives**: Tune alerting thresholds based on application baseline
2. **Correlation**: Link related events to identify attack patterns
3. **Context enrichment**: Add environmental data to security events
4. **Graduated response**: Scale response based on event severity and frequency
5. **Automated remediation**: Implement auto-blocking for clear attack patterns
