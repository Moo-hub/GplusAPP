## Responsive Design Strategy

The G+ Recycling App follows a **mobile-first** approach, where the base styles target mobile devices and then progressively enhance the experience for larger screens using media queries. This approach ensures that:

1. The application is accessible and functional on all devices
2. Core features are prioritized for mobile users
3. Page loading is optimized for mobile networks
4. The interface adapts smoothly across different screen sizes

## Breakpoints

The application uses the following breakpoints to target different device sizes:

- **Extra small (xs)**: < 480px (small mobile devices)
- **Small (sm)**: 480px - 767px (mobile devices)
- **Medium (md)**: 768px - 991px (tablets)
- **Large (lg)**: 992px - 1199px (desktops)
- **Extra large (xl)**: ≥ 1200px (large desktops)

These breakpoints are implemented consistently across the application using CSS media queries:

```css
/* Mobile (xs and sm) */
/* Base styles target mobile first */

/* Tablet (md) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Tablet-specific styles */
}

/* Desktop (lg) */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  /* Desktop-specific styles */
}

/* Large Desktop (xl) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  /* Large desktop-specific styles */
}
```

## CSS Class Usage

### Responsive Containers

Use the `.responsive-container` class for containers that need to adapt to screen sizes:

```jsx
<div className="responsive-container">
  {/* Your content here */}
</div>
```

### Responsive Grids

For grid layouts, use the `.responsive-grid` class:

```jsx
<div className="responsive-grid">
  <div className="card">Item 1</div>
  <div className="card">Item 2</div>
  <div className="card">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

### Form Layouts

For responsive forms, use the provided form classes:

```jsx
<div className="form-row">
  <div className="form-col form-col-md form-col-lg-6">
    <div className="form-group">
      <label className="form-label">First Name</label>
      <input type="text" className="form-control" />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="form-col form-col-md form-col-lg-6">
    <div className="form-group">
      <label className="form-label">Last Name</label>
      <input type="text" className="form-control" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Visibility Helpers

To hide elements on mobile:

```jsx
<div className="hide-on-mobile">
  This will be hidden on mobile devices
</div>
```

To show elements only on mobile:

```jsx
<div className="show-on-mobile">
  This will be shown only on mobile devices
</div>
```

### Responsive Tables

For tables that need to be responsive:

```jsx
<div className="table-responsive">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

### Responsive Buttons

For buttons that fill the width on mobile:

```jsx
<button className="btn btn-primary btn-block">
  Full Width Button
</button>
```

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Buttons

Buttons are designed to be touch-friendly with:

- Minimum touch target size of 44px height
- Full width on mobile when appropriate using `.btn-block` class
- Proper spacing between adjacent buttons

### Forms

Forms adjust their layout based on screen size:

- Single-column layout on mobile
- Multi-column layout on larger screens
- Touch-optimized form controls
- Clear validation messages

### Cards and Containers

Cards and containers adapt their layout based on screen size:

- Full width on mobile
- Grid layout on larger screens
- Appropriate padding that scales with screen size

### Tables and Data Displays

Tables adapt to small screens by:

- Horizontal scrolling for wide tables
- Responsive layout that stacks on mobile
- Data prioritization to show the most important information first

## Layout and Navigation

### Responsive Navigation

The application implements a responsive navigation system with a hamburger menu pattern:

```jsx
<button 
  className="mobile-nav-toggle" 
  onClick={toggleNav}
  aria-label={isNavOpen ? t('nav.close') : t('nav.menu')}
  data-testid="mobile-nav-toggle"
>
  {isNavOpen ? '✕' : '☰'}
</button>
<div className={`nav-links ${isNavOpen ? 'open' : ''}`} data-testid="nav-links">
  {/* Navigation links */}
</div>
```

The CSS implementation:

```css
/* Mobile Navigation - Hamburger Menu */
.mobile-nav-toggle {
  display: none;
  background: none;
  border: none;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  cursor: pointer;
  color: #333;
}

/* Mobile responsiveness */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Show mobile navigation toggle */
  .mobile-nav-toggle {
    display: block;
  }
  
  /* Convert navbar to vertical layout on mobile */
  .navbar {
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
  
  /* Hide nav links by default on mobile */
  .nav-links {
    display: none;
    width: 100%;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 1rem;
    padding: 1rem 0;
  }
  
  /* When nav is open (will be toggled with JavaScript) */
  .nav-links.open {
    display: flex;
    order: 3;
  }
}
```

## RTL Support and Responsiveness

The G+ Recycling App supports right-to-left (RTL) languages like Arabic while maintaining responsiveness:

- Uses the `dir` attribute to control text direction
- CSS properties respect the reading direction using logical properties
- Special adjustments for RTL interfaces on mobile

Example from the codebase:

```css
.nav-links {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1.5rem;
}

[dir="rtl"] .nav-links {
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
}

.auth-links {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}

[dir="rtl"] .auth-links {
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
}
```

Language switching also updates the document direction:

```jsx
const changeLanguage = (lng) => {
  i18n.changeLanguage(lng);
  document.documentElement.lang = lng;
  document.dir = lng === 'ar' ? 'rtl' : 'ltr';
};
```

## Testing Mobile Responsiveness

The application includes a ViewportIndicator component that displays the current viewport size during development. This helps with testing responsive designs across different screen sizes.

```jsx
// src/components/dev/ViewportIndicator.jsx
const ViewportIndicator = () => {
  // ... implementation
  return (
    <div style={{
      position: 'fixed',
      bottom: '10px',
      right: isRTL ? 'auto' : '10px',
      left: isRTL ? '10px' : 'auto',
      background: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)',
      color: 'white',
      padding: '5px 10px',
      borderRadius: '4px',
      fontSize: '12px',
      zIndex: 9999
    }}>
      {dimensions.width}x{dimensions.height} - {getBreakpointName(dimensions.width)}
    </div>
  );
};
```

To test thoroughly:

1. Use browser developer tools to simulate different device sizes
2. Test on actual mobile devices when possible
3. Verify touch interactions work properly (larger touch targets)
4. Ensure text is readable without zooming
5. Check that forms are usable on small screens

## Performance Considerations

Mobile responsiveness also considers performance optimizations:

1. **Optimized Images**: Use responsive image techniques to serve appropriate image sizes
2. **Critical CSS**: Inline critical CSS for faster initial rendering on mobile
3. **Lazy Loading**: Defer non-essential resources, especially for mobile networks
4. **Touch Optimization**: Optimize for touch interactions with appropriate target sizes

## Best Practices

1. **Mobile-first approach**: Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
2. **Touch-friendly UI**: Use min-height of 44-48px for interactive elements
3. **Flexible images**: Always use `img-fluid` class for images
4. **Avoid fixed widths**: Use percentages or responsive units (rem, em)
5. **Test real devices**: Browser emulation isn't always accurate
6. **Optimize performance**: Mobile users may have slower connections

## Components with Enhanced Mobile Support

The following components have been specifically optimized for mobile:

- Layout (navigation with hamburger menu)
- Card (responsive padding and sizing)
- Form controls (optimized for touch)
- PickupForm (responsive calendar and time slots)
- LanguageSwitcher (adapts to screen size and document direction)
- OfflineNotification (important for mobile users with intermittent connectivity)

## Future Improvements

Areas that could benefit from further mobile optimization:

1. Dashboard charts and data visualizations
2. Complex tables with many columns
3. Multi-step workflows
4. Image galleries and media displays
5. Enhanced touch gestures for common actions
6. Adaptive content loading for different network conditions
