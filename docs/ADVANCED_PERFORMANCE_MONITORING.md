# Advanced Performance Monitoring

In addition to the basic performance metrics, the G+ App includes advanced performance monitoring capabilities focused on user experience and complex interactions.

## Advanced Performance Commands

The system provides additional Cypress commands for measuring advanced performance metrics:

- `cy.measureInteractionFlow(flowName, steps)`: Measure a multi-step interaction flow with step-by-step timing
- `cy.measurePerceivedPerformance(pageName)`: Measure user-perceived performance metrics like FP, FCP
- `cy.measureLayoutStability(pageName, durationMs)`: Measure layout stability similar to Cumulative Layout Shift
- `cy.measureMemoryConsumption(componentName, operationFn, durationMs)`: Track memory usage patterns during operations
- `cy.withNetworkCondition(condition, testFn)`: Test performance under different network conditions
- `cy.benchmarkFunction(name, implementations)`: Compare performance of different implementation approaches

## Advanced Metrics Tracked

These advanced commands track additional metrics:

### Interaction Flow Metrics
- **Flow Total Time**: Total time to complete a multi-step interaction flow
- **Flow Step Time**: Time taken for each step in a flow
- **Flow Efficiency**: Ratio of ideal time to actual time (higher is better)

### Perceived Performance
- **First Paint**: Time until the first pixel is painted
- **First Contentful Paint**: Time until the first content is painted
- **Approximate Largest Contentful Paint**: Estimated time until the largest content element is painted

### Layout Stability
- **Layout Stability Score**: Measure of visual stability during page loads (lower is better)
- **Shift Impact**: Impact of layout shifts on the user experience

### Memory Consumption
- **Memory Peak**: Peak memory usage during operations
- **Memory Growth**: Growth in memory usage over time
- **Potential Memory Leaks**: Detection of potential memory leaks

### Network Condition Testing
- **3G Performance**: Performance metrics under simulated 3G network
- **2G Performance**: Performance metrics under simulated 2G network
- **Slow Connection**: Performance metrics under simulated slow connection

### Implementation Benchmarking
- **Execution Time**: Average execution time for different implementations
- **Relative Performance**: Comparison of different implementation approaches

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the advanced performance commands:

```javascript
describe('Advanced Performance Tests', () => {
  it('should measure multi-step interaction flow', () => {
    // Initialize a flow measurement
    const flow = cy.measureInteractionFlow('checkout-process');
    
    // First step
    flow.step('Product Selection');
    // Perform product selection actions
    
    // Second step
    flow.step('Cart Review');
    // Perform cart review actions
    
    // Third step
    flow.step('Checkout');
    // Perform checkout actions
    
    // End flow measurement
    flow.end({
      category: 'user-flow',
      critical: true
    });
  });
  
  it('should measure perceived performance', () => {
    cy.visit('/dashboard');
    cy.measurePerceivedPerformance('dashboard');
  });
  
  it('should test under poor network conditions', () => {
    cy.withNetworkCondition('3g', () => {
      cy.visit('/');
      cy.measurePageLoad('homepage-3g');
    });
  });
});
```

## Integration with Performance Dashboard

The advanced metrics are automatically integrated with the Grafana performance dashboard, providing visualizations for:

- Interaction flow efficiency over time
- Memory consumption patterns
- Layout stability across different pages
- Performance under various network conditions
- Implementation benchmark comparisons
